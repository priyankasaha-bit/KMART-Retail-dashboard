📊 Key Insights
- KMART is one of the leading retail stores in Australia. 
Behind the shelves of Kmart lies many hidden narratives- While digging deep, I unearthed some interesting facts about this store:

🔥 While KMART ONLINE only makes up 29% of transactions, it likely contributes a disproportionately high share of large-value sales- particularly in the category of clothing and fashion which occupies roughly 21.9% of the total online share.

📍 NSW alone contributes to 29% of the sales entries- due to high urban density or higher online demand.

📦June 2023 and August 2024 has shown some unusual spike in sales, likely aligned with seasonal events such as end-of-year holidays or back-to-school periods.

🌍 Chatswood in New South Wales is on fire- maximum transactions are noticed here. Interesting isn’t it? Kmart might think of use it as a model for high-performing locations, testing new layouts, product displays, or customer service innovations.

🧍‍♀️One buyer alone pulling in 770 transactions. Hard to believe …..but true!!! Although Bruce Curran is the leading customer, Amy Buchanan buys the maximum products from Baby and Nursery category

🎯 Most of the people tends to buy cheaper products, while some spend a lumpsum amount. We may summarise that these are either institutional buyers or tend to order online in bulks. 

What was once static reporting, now becomes strategic intelligence — with interactive filters that let stakeholders pivot by channel, zoom into state-level insights, and shift across time frames in real time.
Data tells stories — and like a Pandora’s box, it reveals unexpected truths once opened.
